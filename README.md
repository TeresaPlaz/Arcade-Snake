# Arcade-Snake

Ironhack project #1

A one-player JavaScript based arcade game where the player attempts to eat apples by running into them with the head of the snake. Each apple eaten makes the snake longer and also after a few apples the control keys start twisting, so controlling is progressively more difficult. 

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Git, CSS, HTML.
